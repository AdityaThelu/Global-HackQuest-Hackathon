## Project Overview

As part of a 7-member team, I collaborated on the end-to-end planning and execution of a virtual global hackathon over 4 weeks. Our responsibilities spanned strategizing hackathon themes and goals, selecting project management tools like Trello, building timelines with GANTT charts, and developing a $250K budget. 

A major focus was designing a robust quality control framework encompassing 15+ aspects including accessibility, innovation, branding, data privacy, and fair judging processes. I contributed to framing objectives, standards, actions, and frequencies for quality control. 

This intensive project provided hands-on experience with key PM disciplines - budgeting, scheduling, risk management, stakeholder engagement, and quality assurance. Operating in a team setting was invaluable preparation for delivering complex projects by leveraging individual strengths. The hands-on learning and mentoring from industry experts enabled us to gain practical skills and insights into bringing impactful PM initiatives to life.

This project encompasses materials related to a participation in the HackQuest Global Hackathon. It includes presentation materials and a quality control framework document, suggesting a focus on presenting a solution or project developed during the hackathon.
